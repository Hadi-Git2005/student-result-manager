# Student Result Manager

This project is being developed step by step to practice
Python programming and logical problem solving.

### Current Features
- Store student details and marks
- Calculate total marks
- Rank students based on overall performance
- Rank students by individual subjects
- Identify subject toppers
- Find weak subjects based on a threshold

The goal of this project is to understand how logic,
data structures, and modular code work together.
More features will be added as I continue learning.
